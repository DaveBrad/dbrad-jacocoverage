    <h1 id="howtotitle">The Object Test Data (OTD) License Agreement</h1>
    <h4>Terms and Conditions</h4>
    <p>Reviewing this license document is not an acceptance or agreement with
      the license.</p>
    <p>Object Test Data (OTD) source code, binary/object/executable/library 
      and documentation are copyrighted.</p>

    <p>Using the executable form or the documentation (excluding
      license document) to build a run-able test is acceptance and agreement with the license.</p>
    <p>Object Test Data example code within the documentation may be freely used
      to create appropriate works for a user's runtime testing needs.
    </p>

    <p>The source code is restricted from installation, modification, 
      distribution/redistribution/deployment unless explicitly authorized. The source code
      is generally unavailable as viewable or executable.</p>

    <h4>Introduction</h4>
    <p>Object test data (OTD) is a packaged class-path JAR and/or sibling
      documentation, either separate or combined, it is referred to as
      the "library". The license applies even if the JAR/ZIP is expanded into/to a
      structure.</p>

    <p>OTD is a third-party runtime component within a licensee's or
      user's environment and is a "library". The "library" is original content 
      with liberal license for runtime usage.</p>

    <div class='divcompress'>
      <p>"Licensee" is an individual or entity that accepts and agrees with 
        the license terms and conditions.
      <ul>
        <li>Persons using the "library" on behalf/within an entity
          structure/organization/company are licensee's by entity relationship.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <p>"User" or "users" (akin to "licensee") are persons or entities that use
      the "library" in their environment to perform goals/tasks/processes where the
      "library" is used. They are "licensee" by usage of the "library" (runtime or
      documentation).</p>

    <div class='divcompress'>
      <p>There are restrictions on
        "distribution/redistribution/deployment" of the "library".</p>
      <ul>
        <li>The "library", if not from the author, could be modified to harm a
          licensee's or user's environment, as is true for many other programs/libraries.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <div class='divcompress'>
      <p>"Runtime" is  "library" execution:</P>
      <ul>
        <li>as a loaded class-path item/library used by a licensee, or</li>
        <li>when a licensee's code is compiled against the "library" as a class-path dependence, or</li>
        <li>as an emulation/simulation manually of the documentation</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h4>Usage</h4>
    <div class='divcompress'>
      <ul>
        <li>The runtime usage of the library is royalty-free, non-commercial or
          commercial.</li>
        <li>The binary/object form may be installed on any number of systems, as
          per the distribution/redistribution/deployment conditions.</li>
        <li>The documentation may be installed on any number of systems, as per
          the distribution/redistribution/deployment conditions.</li>
        <li>Use implies acceptance and/or agreement with the license.</li>
        <li>The runtime usage with the library's source code needs separate explicit
          authorization and needs to be covered by a different license.</li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <p>This is a liberal license to use the "library" for or during runtime
      usage.</p>

    <h4>License Acceptance and/or Agreement</h4>
    <div class='divcompress'>
      <ul>
        <li>By using the "library" in a runtime system a "user" or "licensee" is
          agreeing to and accepting the license.</li>
        <li>Using the documentation to implement code to be executed is agreeing
          to and accepting the license.
          <ul>
            <li>Execution is considered to be on a device or manual emulation walk-through.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        <li>You may not use the library, or may not accept the License Agreement
          if you are a person barred from receiving the library under the laws of
          Canada, or including the country in which you reside, or from which you use
          the library.</li>

Tip: to create a link which will open in an external web browser, try:
<object classid="java:org.netbeans.modules.javahelp.BrowserDisplayer">
    <param name="content" value="http://www.netbeans.org/">
    <param name="text" value="<html><u>http://www.netbeans.org/</u></html>">
    <param name="textFontSize" value="medium">
    <param name="textColor" value="blue">
</object>
To create a link to a help set from another module, you need to know the code name base and path, e.g.:
<a href="nbdocs://org.netbeans.modules.usersguide/org/netbeans/modules/usersguide/configure/configure_options.html">Using the Options Window</a>
(This link will behave sanely if that module is disabled or missing.)

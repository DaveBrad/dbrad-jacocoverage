      <h1>Introduction dbrad-jacocoverage</h1>
      <div class="divindent">
        <p> Code coverage is a very useful tool for the development of applications
          of all kinds. Coverage is most useful in test-driven-development, but 
          also for other development methodologies where testing for code
          coverage adds significant value to quality.</p>
        <p>Dbrad-jacocoverage uses www.elcemma.org jacocoagent to do 
          on-the-fly code coverage, in that it instruments at run time and
          captures coverage data during the run. Then the coverage data is
          processed to obtain results.</p>
        <p>Also, dbrad-jacocoverage is a significant modification to 
          tikione-jacocoverage, which has been in an archived status since May/2016. 
          There are modified and additional capabilities in dbrad-jacocoverage 
          which handle project dependencies, include and exclude package patterns
          better and in a more configure-able manner
          (see  following <a href="#capablity">dbrad-jacocoverage capabilities</a> ).</p>

      <h1 id="introext">About dbrad-jacocoverage</h1>
      <div class="divindent">
        <p>Dbrad-jacocoverage provides basic global-settings which does
          only a project's source folder coverage of a principle-project.

          Processing beyond just the principle-project, requires the 
          project-specific settings to expand coverage components to include coverage 
          for source &amp; test-source folders, packages within folder(s), and selection of 
          dependent/associated/sub-project projects as inclusive components. 

          This implies that a Netbeans project as a whole and its coverage is
          achieve-able, with selective component management thrown in 
          (say: just JUnits).</p>

        <h2 id='bckgnd'>Background</h2>
        <div class="divindent">
          <p>
            Coverage may be used in an operational/QA management process to
            assist in determining quality by adding coverage metrics as an
            additional measure, but by no means the only measure. However
            for development, coverage provides quick feedback as to a developer's
            exercise of their code (assuming they build supporting tests to
            exercise their code).
          </p>
          <p>
            dbrad-jacocoverage came about due to a need to code-coverage a project
            which has multiple libraries as dependent/associate projects. The 
            existing coverage tools on Netbeans IDE prior to dbrad-jacocoverage
            were limiting or expensive. Also, most other coverage tools
            for Netbeans appear to be retired, archived, or no longer maintained; so another
            reason for dbrad-jacocoverage.
          </p>
          <p>dbrad-jacocoverage was created from tikione-jacocoverage as its base.
            The latter
            being limited to processing <b>only</b> the source-code folders for
            a single J2SE/J2EE project (that is: non-inclusive for
            dependent projects, test source code [JUnit,...]). 

            Later in tikione's development, NB-module (NBM) coverage was added with a
            slightly different processing architecture suitable for NBMs, but it too is
            non-inclusive for test source code.</p>
          <p>
            Tikione-jacocoverage has been archived by its author. See
            <a href="https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/tikione-jacocoverage"

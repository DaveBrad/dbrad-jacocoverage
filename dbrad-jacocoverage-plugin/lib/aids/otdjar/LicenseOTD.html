        <p>Object Test Data (OTD) source code, binary/object/executable/library 
            and documentation are copyrighted.</p>

        <p>Using the executable form or the documentation (excluding

        <p>Object Test Data example code within the documentation may be freely used

        <p>The source code is restricted from installation, modification,

        <h4>Introduction</h4>
        <p>Object test data (OTD) is a packaged class-path JAR and/or sibling
            documentation, either separate or combined, it is referred to as
            the "library". The license applies even if the JAR/ZIP is expanded into/to a
            structure.</p>

        <p>OTD is a third-party runtime/class-path component within a licensee's or
            user's environment and is a "library". The "library" is original content 
            with liberal license for runtime usage.</p>

        <h4>Terms</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><div class='divcompress'>
            <p>"Licensee" is an individual or entity that accepts and agrees with 
                the license terms and conditions.
            <ul>
                <li>Persons using the "library" on behalf/within an entity
                    structure/organization/company are licensee's by entity relationship.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <li><div class='divcompress'>
            <p>"library" is the execute-able form used:</P>
            <ul>
                <li>as a loaded class-path item/library used by a licensee, or</li>
                <li>when a licensee's code is compiled against the "library" as a class-path dependence, or</li>
                <li>as an emulation/simulation manually of the documentation</li>
            </ul>
        </div>


        <li><p>"User" or "users" (akin to "licensee") are persons or entities that use
            the "library" in their environment to perform goals/tasks/processes where the
            "library" is used. They are "licensee" by usage of the "library" (runtime or
            documentation).</p>
        </ul>

        <div class='divcompress'>
            <p>There are restrictions on
                "distribution/redistribution/deployment" of the "library".</p>
            <ul>
                <li>The "library", if not from the author, could be modified to harm a
                    licensee's or user's environment, as is true for many other programs/libraries.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        
        <h4>Usage</h4>
        <div class='divcompress'>
            <ul>
                <li>The runtime usage of the "library" is royalty-free, non-commercial or
                    commercial.</li>
                <li>The "library" binary/object form may be installed on any number of systems, as
                    per the distribution/redistribution/deployment conditions.</li>
                <li>The documentation may be installed on any number of systems, as per
                    the distribution/redistribution/deployment conditions.</li>
                <li>Use implies acceptance and/or agreement with the license.</li>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li>The runtime usage with the source code needs separate explicit
                    authorization and needs to be covered by a different license.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
        <p>This is a liberal license to use the "library" for or during runtime
            usage ("freeware").</p>

        <h4>License Acceptance and/or Agreement</h4>
        <div class='divcompress'>
            <ul>
                <li>By using the "library" in a runtime system a "user" or "licensee" is
                    agreeing to and accepting the license.</li>
                <li>Using the documentation to implement code to be executed is agreeing
                    to and accepting the license.
                    <ul>
                        <li>Execution is considered to be on a device or manual emulation walk-through.</li>

                </li>

                <li>You may NOT use the library, or may NOT accept the License Agreement
                    if you are a person barred from receiving the library under the laws of
                    Canada, or including the country in which you reside, or from which you use
                    the library.</li>
